// we have set up multiple routes 

// so how do we set up our server to send our response 
// when someone tries to get something at a particular route
// we set up using get method on app



// configure what server should do when someone tries to get resource
// at a specific url
// get method takes 2 args 1)route 2)func : what we want to do when 
// someone visits that route .
// this func gets called with 2 args 1)obj containing info about the
// incoming request to the server
// 2) response  has methods

/////////////////////////////////////////// Want index.html////////////////////////////////////////////////
// if want to get index.html page as we want write hole index.html code in app.get(' ')
// to do it : 
// gives current file and directory name
console.log(__dirname); // /Users/anmoltuteja/Desktop/learning-NodeJS/web-server/src
console.log(__filename); // /Users/anmoltuteja/Desktop/learning-NodeJS/web-server/src/App.js

// path to public dir
console.log(path.join(__dirname, '../public'));
const PublicDirectoryPath = path.join(__dirname, '../public');

// use is used to customise our server will learn later
//here we are config static .... hbs is for dynamic
//if our public dir has indexedDB.html we gwt that
app.use(express.static(PublicDirectoryPath));
// express.static():
// 	•	express.static() is a built -in middleware function in Express.js that serves static files.
// 	•	It is used to serve files from the file system, such as images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, or HTML files, without having to define specific routes for them.
// 	•	It maps the files in the specified directory to be directly accessible via the URL path.

// static means our our assests are static and they do not change
// need template engine to render dynamic web pages

// now no need to set app.get(' ') as app.use and for other rotes there was a navigation : :::; 
// When you use app.use(express.static(PublicDirectoryPath)); in an Express.js application, it serves static files (like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript) from the directory specified by PublicDirectoryPath. This means that any file inside this directory can be accessed by clients via a direct URL without the need to define specific routes for them using app.get.
// For example:
// 	•	If PublicDirectoryPath is set to a directory called public and there’s a file index.html inside, visiting http://localhost:3000/index.html will directly serve that file.
// Thus, you don’t need to define app.get() for serving static files from this directory. However, if you want to serve dynamic content or other routes not covered by static files, you will still need to use app.get() for those cases.
// If your app only serves static content, you may not need app.get() at all. But for handling routes dynamically, app.get() is necessary.
//Yes, the same concept applies to the /help route if you have a static HTML file for it in your PublicDirectoryPath. For example, if you have a file named help.html in the PublicDirectoryPath, accessing http://localhost:3000/help.html will automatically serve the help.html file without needing an app.get('/help') route.
// However, if you want to serve dynamic content for the /help route, you would still need
